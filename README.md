# Percolation

#Project for Data Structures and Algorithms class. Started with N*N grid, randomly opened up cells that would be "filled" if connected to another filled cell. If there is a full site at the bottom row, the system is said to have percolated. Used to study the question: if sites are independently set to be open with vacancy probability p, what is the probability that the system percolates?
